Build or grow a local SEO agency using the `local-seo:local-seo-agency` skill. Invoke the skill, then follow the relevant section based on what the user needs (service models, pricing, sales process, lead generation, SOPs, team building, or client retention).

If the user provided a specific topic or question as an argument, use that to focus the response. Otherwise, ask what aspect of running or building their SEO business they need help with.
