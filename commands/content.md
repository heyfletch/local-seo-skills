Create a content strategy using the `local-seo:local-seo-content` skill. Invoke the skill, then follow the relevant sections based on what the user needs (full content plan, blog topics, content calendar, social media strategy, etc.).

If the user provided a business name or specific content type as an argument, use that to begin. Otherwise, determine what content planning is needed.
