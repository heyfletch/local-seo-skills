Build a high-converting, SEO-optimized service page using the `local-seo:local-seo-service-page` skill. Invoke the skill, then follow its full page-building process.

If the user provided a service name as an argument, use that as the target service. Otherwise, ask for the required information as specified in the skill's "Before Writing" section.
