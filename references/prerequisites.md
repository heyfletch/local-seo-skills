## Required MCPs

Before first use, verify these MCPs are installed and active:
- **ahrefs** — for backlink analysis and keyword research
- **dataforseo** — for SERP data and ranking checks

If not installed:
1. Ask the user if they want to install them
2. Walk through: `/mcp add [mcp-name]` with the correct config
3. Verify connection is working

If installed but not active:
1. Run `/mcp` to check status
2. Activate with `/mcp enable [mcp-name]`
