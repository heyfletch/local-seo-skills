# Content Frameworks

## Content Priorities (2026)

### What Works
- Commercial/transactional intent keywords (less affected by AI Overviews)
- Original research, proprietary data, real case studies
- **Customer stories with full narratives** (highest-performing content type — see Tier 3a)
- Content competitors haven't written (differentiation > copying)
- Answers to specific "People Also Ask" queries
- Scannable format: H2/H3s, short paragraphs, direct answers
- In-content internal links with descriptive anchor text (body text links carry more weight than navigation menu links — build topic silos by interlinking related service and blog pages)
- Tools, calculators, interactive content (AI can't replicate these)
- Video content (YouTube + embedded, increases dwell time)
- First-party experience signals (E-E-A-T)
- **Real photos of people, actual work, and real results** (383-image study: people photos convert best, infographics get most clicks; AI-generated images showed initial gains then declined)

### What's Declining
- Thin "what is X" informational articles (AI answers these directly, CTR down 15-40%)
- Generic content that matches what top competitors already have
- Keyword-stuffed articles without unique angle
- Guest posts on low-quality sites

## Content Type Framework

### Tier 1: Service & Conversion Pages (Create First)
- Dedicated page per service
- Target commercial intent keywords
- 1,500-2,500 words
- Direct business impact
- See: local-seo-service-page skill

### Tier 2: Service Area Pages (Create Second)
- Location-specific pages with unique content
- Target "[service] [city]" keywords
- 1,200-1,800 words
- See: local-seo-area-page skill

### Tier 3: Blog/Resource Content (Ongoing)
- Answer real customer questions
- Target long-tail and KGR keywords
- 1,000-2,000 words (guideline, not KPI — shorter is fine if it answers the question fully)
- Build topical authority
- Content that competitors haven't written

### Tier 3a: Customer Stories (HIGH PRIORITY)
Customer stories dramatically outperform all other content types. These are NOT short testimonials — they're full narratives with specific details. Tested results: +57% conversions (dentist), +350% traffic (painter), outperformed AI content head-to-head.

**How to create:** Interview customers. Cover: the problem, why they chose you, what happened during service, the outcome. Include real photos, actual costs, and timeframes. 200-400 words per story. Add to service pages AND as standalone blog posts.

### Tier 3b: "Honest Review" Pages (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
Create review pages for tools, products, or vendors relevant to your industry. Adding "honest" to title tags produced +58% to +264% traffic increases in tests. Title format: "[Brand Name] Honest Review — [Your Take]". Works best for businesses that use identifiable tools/brands (agencies, consultants, SaaS). Less applicable for pure service businesses (plumber, painter) unless reviewing equipment or suppliers.

### Tier 3c: Interactive Tools
Calculators, quizzes, and assessment tools can rank with minimal or zero text content. If the service involves numbers or decisions, consider a tool instead of (or alongside) a blog post.

### Tier 4: Social & GBP Content (Ongoing)
- GBP posts (2-3/week)
- Social media (platform-dependent)
- Supports engagement and behavioral signals

**GBP Batch Planning:** Instead of deciding what to post each week, plan the entire month in one sitting. Set a primary monthly goal, assign weekly themes (Week 1: educational, Week 2: service highlight, Week 3: social proof, Week 4: conversion push), batch-write all posts, then schedule. See the local-seo-gbp skill for the full workflow.

## 12-Month Content Plan Template

## Blog Topic Generation Process

### Step 1: Mine for Topics

Sources for content ideas:
- **Customer questions** — What do clients ask during consultations?
- **GSC queries** — What are people searching to find you?
- **Competitor content gaps** — What haven't they written about?
- **"People Also Ask"** — Google's related questions for your keywords
- **Industry forums/Reddit** — Real questions people are asking

**Systematic Reddit Analysis:** For deeper topic mining, export 50+ Reddit threads on a topic, upload to an AI tool, and prompt: "Extract the top 10 recurring objections and group them by customer journey stage. Format as a table with: Objection, Frequency, Journey Stage, Content Opportunity." This surfaces real customer concerns that keyword tools miss — especially useful for understanding WHY people search, not just WHAT.

- **Seasonal needs** — What changes by season for your business?
- **Local angles** — Local events, regulations, demographics

### Step 2: Evaluate & Prioritize Topics

For each topic, assess:
- Search volume (from keyword research)
- KGR score (quick wins < 0.25)
- Competition level
- Relevance to services you sell
- Likelihood of converting readers to leads
- Can you add unique perspective or data?

**ICE Scoring Framework:** For formal prioritization, score each topic using ICE:
- **Impact (40%):** Estimated traffic × revenue potential (traffic without revenue is vanity)
- **Confidence (30%):** Can you realistically rank within 6 months given DA and competition?
- **Effort-inverted (30%):** Design needs, research depth, approval processes. Score 1-10, invert.
Multiply weighted scores to rank topics. This often reveals that unglamorous comparison pages outscore viral content ideas.

## Social Media Strategy

### Platform Selection (Local Business)

| Platform | Best For | Posting Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| **GBP Posts** | All local businesses | 2-3/week (minimum) |
| **Facebook** | Community engagement, local audiences | 3-5/week |
| **LinkedIn** | Professional services (lawyers, financial, healthcare) | 2-3/week |
| **Instagram** | Visual services (home services, food, fitness) | 4-7/week |
| **YouTube** | All (video builds E-E-A-T + dwell time) | 1-2/month |
| **X/Twitter** | Only if already active | Daily or skip entirely |

### Content Mix (80/20 Rule)
- 80% value (educational, helpful, entertaining)
- 20% promotional (services, offers, CTAs)

### Social Post Types
1. **Tips & Education** — Share expertise, answer common questions
2. **Behind-the-Scenes** — Team photos, office culture, day-in-the-life
3. **Case Studies / Results** — Before/after, client outcomes (with permission)
4. **Local Community** — Events, partnerships, sponsorships
5. **Promotions** — Seasonal offers, special pricing
6. **Engagement** — Questions, polls, "ask me anything"
7. **User-Generated** — Share client photos/reviews (with permission)

## Content Refresh Strategy

Review existing content quarterly:

1. **Top performers** (high traffic) — Update with fresh data, expand sections
2. **High impressions, low CTR** — Rewrite meta title and description
3. **Ranking 11-20** — Optimize for target keyword, add internal links, expand content
4. **Underperforming** — Update, consolidate with related content, or remove
5. **All content older than 12 months** — Check for accuracy, update dates

### Service Page Refresh Cycle

Consider refreshing service pages on a ~3 month cycle in addition to blog content. A "significant" service page update means:
- Change to the title tag
- Change to the H1
- Structural changes to H2s
- ~30% of content updated

After building all service pages and sub-service pages, cycle back to refresh the earliest ones, then repeat. This continuous refresh cycle ensures freshness signals are maintained across your highest-value pages.

### Alternative Strategy: Service Page Cycling (Instead of Blogging)

Some agencies (notably WhiteSpark) skip blogging entirely and invest that time in a continuous service page refresh cycle: build all service pages → build sub-service pages → refresh the first batch (~30% content update, title/H1/H2 changes) → repeat on a 3-month cycle. This can be more effective than blogging for businesses where:
- The business has 10+ distinct services
- Content budget is limited
- The industry has low informational search demand

This is an alternative approach worth considering, not a replacement for the blog strategy outlined above. Many businesses benefit from both. Evaluate based on the client's resources and industry.

## Post-Publish Validation Signals

After publishing content, monitor these early warning signals:
- **Indexation speed:** Check if new pages are indexed within 48 hours (GSC URL Inspection)
- **Impression growth:** Track impressions before clicks — impressions predict future click growth
- **User behavior:** Microsoft Clarity or Hotjar for scroll depth, engagement, bounce behavior
- **Internal link clicks:** Track if your content architecture is working (are people clicking through related articles?)

Consider setting up weekly monitoring summaries: "This week: X new keywords in top 10, Y pieces hit 1,000 impressions, Z featured snippet won." Small celebrations maintain momentum with clients and teams.

## AI-Optimized Content (AEO/GEO)

To maximize visibility in AI search results (Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, etc.):

1. **Structure for extraction** — Use clear H2/H3 hierarchy with direct answers
2. **Answer questions directly** — Don't bury answers in paragraphs of preamble
3. **Include entity information** — Business name, location, credentials, years of experience
4. **Cite sources** — Reference authoritative data when making claims
5. **Keep it concise** — AI favors scannable, no-fluff content
6. **First-party data** — Include original statistics, research, or proprietary insights
7. **Update regularly** — AI systems prefer recently updated content
8. **Multi-site brand presence** — For AI visibility, you don't need to rank your own website #1. You need your brand mentioned across multiple results in the top 10-20. Invest in digital PR, "Best [Service] in [City]" list placements, industry publication mentions, and strong directory presence. LLMs synthesize answers from multiple sources.
