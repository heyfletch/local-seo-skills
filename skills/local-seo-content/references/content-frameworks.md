# Content Frameworks

## Content Priorities (2026)

### What Works
- Commercial/transactional intent keywords (less affected by AI Overviews)
- Original research, proprietary data, real case studies
- **Customer stories with full narratives** (highest-performing content type — see Tier 3a)
- Content competitors haven't written (differentiation > copying)
- Answers to specific "People Also Ask" queries
- Scannable format: H2/H3s, short paragraphs, direct answers
- In-content internal links with descriptive anchor text (body text links carry more weight than navigation menu links — build topic silos by interlinking related service and blog pages)
- Tools, calculators, interactive content (AI can't replicate these)
- Video content (YouTube + embedded, increases dwell time)
- First-party experience signals (E-E-A-T)
- **Real photos of people, actual work, and real results** (383-image study: people photos convert best, infographics get most clicks; AI-generated images showed initial gains then declined)

### What's Declining
- Thin "what is X" informational articles (AI answers these directly, CTR down 15-40%)
- Generic content that matches what top competitors already have
- Keyword-stuffed articles without unique angle
- Guest posts on low-quality sites

## Content Type Framework

### Tier 1: Service & Conversion Pages (Create First)
- Dedicated page per service
- Target commercial intent keywords
- 1,500-2,500 words
- Direct business impact
- See: local-seo-service-page skill

### Tier 2: Service Area Pages (Create Second)
- Location-specific pages with unique content
- Target "[service] [city]" keywords
- 1,200-1,800 words
- See: local-seo-area-page skill

### Tier 3: Blog/Resource Content (Ongoing)
- Answer real customer questions
- Target long-tail and KGR keywords
- 1,000-2,000 words (guideline, not KPI — shorter is fine if it answers the question fully)
- Build topical authority
- Content that competitors haven't written

**Warning — informational content and geographic mismatch:** For local businesses, generic "how to" blog content (e.g., "how to unclog a drain") often attracts traffic from searchers outside your service area who will never become customers. A Lasik center in Chicago getting 80K visits/month from "does Lasik hurt" searchers in Florida and New York gets zero calls from that traffic. Prioritize transactional "who can do this for me" content (service pages, area pages) over informational "how do I do this" content. When blogging, add local context to informational topics (e.g., "Denver homeowner's guide to drain maintenance" vs. "how to unclog a drain") to attract geographically relevant readers. Service page creation and refresh cycles may deliver better ROI than blogging for many local businesses — see Alternative Strategy below.

### Tier 3a: Customer Stories (HIGH PRIORITY)
Customer stories dramatically outperform all other content types. These are NOT short testimonials — they're full narratives with specific details. Tested results: +57% conversions (dentist), +350% traffic (painter), outperformed AI content head-to-head.

**How to create:** Interview customers. Cover: the problem, why they chose you, what happened during service, the outcome. Include real photos, actual costs, and timeframes. 200-400 words per story. Add to service pages AND as standalone blog posts.

### Tier 3b: "Honest Review" Pages (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
Create review pages for tools, products, or vendors relevant to your industry. Adding "honest" to title tags produced +58% to +264% traffic increases in tests. Title format: "[Brand Name] Honest Review — [Your Take]". Works best for businesses that use identifiable tools/brands (agencies, consultants, SaaS). Less applicable for pure service businesses (plumber, painter) unless reviewing equipment or suppliers.

### Tier 3c: Interactive Tools
Calculators, quizzes, and assessment tools can rank with minimal or zero text content. If the service involves numbers or decisions, consider a tool instead of (or alongside) a blog post.

### Tier 4: Social & GBP Content (Ongoing)
- GBP posts (2-3/week)
- Social media (platform-dependent)
- Supports engagement and behavioral signals

**GBP Batch Planning:** Instead of deciding what to post each week, plan the entire month in one sitting. Set a primary monthly goal, assign weekly themes (Week 1: educational, Week 2: service highlight, Week 3: social proof, Week 4: conversion push), batch-write all posts, then schedule. See the local-seo-gbp skill for the full workflow.

## 12-Month Content Plan Template

### Months 1-3: Foundation
- **Focus:** Service pages, core site content, GBP setup
- **Blog:** Answer top 8-12 FAQ questions (KGR opportunities)
- **GBP:** Establish posting cadence, seed Q&A
- **Goal:** Build baseline topical authority

### Months 4-6: Expansion
- **Focus:** Service area pages, comprehensive guides
- **Blog:** Deeper topic exploration, comparison content, "best X for Y" articles
- **GBP:** Consistent posting, photo/video uploads
- **Goal:** Cover primary keyword targets

### Months 7-9: Authority
- **Focus:** Original research, case studies, tools/calculators
- **Blog:** Advanced topics, thought leadership, local expert content
- **GBP:** Share case studies, event announcements
- **Goal:** E-E-A-T signals, differentiation from competitors

### Months 10-12: Optimization
- **Focus:** Refresh top content, seasonal content
- **Blog:** Year-end topics, predictions, trend analysis
- **GBP:** Seasonal promotions, year-in-review
- **Goal:** Maintain rankings, capture seasonal opportunities

## Seasonal Content Ideas by Quarter

**Q1 (Jan-Mar):**
- New year planning/resolution content
- Tax-related topics (if applicable)
- "What to expect in [year]" guides
- Fresh start / new beginnings angles

**Q2 (Apr-Jun):**
- Spring project topics
- Comprehensive "ultimate guide" content
- Before/after case studies
- Outdoor/seasonal service content

**Q3 (Jul-Sep):**
- Back-to-school angles (if relevant)
- Fall preparation content
- End-of-year planning kickoff
- Summer project wrap-ups

**Q4 (Oct-Dec):**
- Holiday-specific content
- Year-end guides and checklists
- "Best of [year]" roundups
- Planning for next year

## Blog Topic Generation Process

### Step 1: Mine for Topics

Sources for content ideas:
- **Customer questions** — What do clients ask during consultations?
- **GSC queries** — What are people searching to find you?
- **Competitor content gaps** — What haven't they written about?
- **"People Also Ask"** — Google's related questions for your keywords
- **Industry forums/Reddit** — Real questions people are asking

**Systematic Reddit Analysis:** For deeper topic mining, export 50+ Reddit threads on a topic, upload to an AI tool, and prompt: "Extract the top 10 recurring objections and group them by customer journey stage. Format as a table with: Objection, Frequency, Journey Stage, Content Opportunity." This surfaces real customer concerns that keyword tools miss — especially useful for understanding WHY people search, not just WHAT.

- **Seasonal needs** — What changes by season for your business?
- **Local angles** — Local events, regulations, demographics

### Step 2: Evaluate & Prioritize Topics

For each topic, assess:
- Search volume (from keyword research)
- KGR score (quick wins < 0.25)
- Competition level
- Relevance to services you sell
- Likelihood of converting readers to leads
- Can you add unique perspective or data?

**ICE Scoring Framework:** For formal prioritization, score each topic using ICE:
- **Impact (40%):** Estimated traffic × revenue potential (traffic without revenue is vanity)
- **Confidence (30%):** Can you realistically rank within 6 months given DA and competition?
- **Effort-inverted (30%):** Design needs, research depth, approval processes. Score 1-10, invert.
Multiply weighted scores to rank topics. This often reveals that unglamorous comparison pages outscore viral content ideas.

## Social Media Strategy

### Platform Selection (Local Business)

| Platform | Best For | Posting Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| **GBP Posts** | All local businesses | 2-3/week (minimum) |
| **Facebook** | Community engagement, local audiences | 3-5/week |
| **LinkedIn** | Professional services (lawyers, financial, healthcare) | 2-3/week |
| **Instagram** | Visual services (home services, food, fitness) | 4-7/week |
| **YouTube** | All (video builds E-E-A-T + dwell time) | 1-2/month |
| **X/Twitter** | Only if already active | Daily or skip entirely |

### Content Mix (80/20 Rule)
- 80% value (educational, helpful, entertaining)
- 20% promotional (services, offers, CTAs)

### Social Post Types
1. **Tips & Education** — Share expertise, answer common questions
2. **Behind-the-Scenes** — Team photos, office culture, day-in-the-life
3. **Case Studies / Results** — Before/after, client outcomes (with permission)
4. **Local Community** — Events, partnerships, sponsorships
5. **Promotions** — Seasonal offers, special pricing
6. **Engagement** — Questions, polls, "ask me anything"
7. **User-Generated** — Share client photos/reviews (with permission)

## Content Refresh Strategy

Review existing content quarterly:

1. **Top performers** (high traffic) — Update with fresh data, expand sections
2. **High impressions, low CTR** — Rewrite meta title and description
3. **Ranking 11-20** — Optimize for target keyword, add internal links, expand content
4. **Underperforming** — Update, consolidate with related content, or remove
5. **All content older than 12 months** — Check for accuracy, update dates

### Service Page Refresh Cycle

Consider refreshing service pages on a ~3 month cycle in addition to blog content. A "significant" service page update means:
- Change to the title tag
- Change to the H1
- Structural changes to H2s
- ~30% of content updated

After building all service pages and sub-service pages, cycle back to refresh the earliest ones, then repeat. This continuous refresh cycle ensures freshness signals are maintained across your highest-value pages.

### Alternative Strategy: Service Page Cycling (Instead of Blogging)

Some agencies (notably WhiteSpark) skip blogging entirely and invest that time in a continuous service page refresh cycle: build all service pages → build sub-service pages → refresh the first batch (~30% content update, title/H1/H2 changes) → repeat on a 3-month cycle. This can be more effective than blogging for businesses where:
- The business has 10+ distinct services
- Content budget is limited
- The industry has low informational search demand

This is an alternative approach worth considering, not a replacement for the blog strategy outlined above. Many businesses benefit from both. Evaluate based on the client's resources and industry.

## Post-Publish Validation Signals

After publishing content, monitor these early warning signals:
- **Indexation speed:** Check if new pages are indexed within 48 hours (GSC URL Inspection)
- **Impression growth:** Track impressions before clicks — impressions predict future click growth
- **User behavior:** Microsoft Clarity or Hotjar for scroll depth, engagement, bounce behavior
- **Internal link clicks:** Track if your content architecture is working (are people clicking through related articles?)

Consider setting up weekly monitoring summaries: "This week: X new keywords in top 10, Y pieces hit 1,000 impressions, Z featured snippet won." Small celebrations maintain momentum with clients and teams.

## AI-Optimized Content (AEO/GEO)

To maximize visibility in AI search results (Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, etc.):

1. **Structure for extraction** — Use clear H2/H3 hierarchy with direct answers
2. **Answer questions directly** — Don't bury answers in paragraphs of preamble
3. **Include entity information** — Business name, location, credentials, years of experience
4. **Cite sources** — Reference authoritative data when making claims
5. **Keep it concise** — AI favors scannable, no-fluff content
6. **First-party data** — Include original statistics, research, or proprietary insights
7. **Update regularly** — AI systems prefer recently updated content
8. **Multi-site brand presence** — For AI visibility, you don't need to rank your own website #1. You need your brand mentioned across multiple results in the top 10-20. Invest in digital PR, "Best [Service] in [City]" list placements, industry publication mentions, and strong directory presence. LLMs synthesize answers from multiple sources.

## Sales Funnel & Lead Magnet Strategy

### Context

Most local businesses rely on "call us" or "fill out this form" as their only conversion path. Adding a sales funnel with lead magnets captures prospects who aren't ready to buy yet but are researching — typically 70-80% of website visitors.

**When to recommend:** Businesses with longer sales cycles (financial planning, home remodeling, legal services), higher price points, or competitive markets where trust must be built before conversion. Less critical for emergency services (plumber for a burst pipe) where the conversion path is naturally short.

### Funnel Structure for Local Businesses

```
AWARENESS (Blog/Social → Website)
    ↓
INTEREST (Lead Magnet → Email Capture)
    ↓
CONSIDERATION (Email Nurture Sequence)
    ↓
DECISION (Consultation/Quote → Customer)
    ↓
ADVOCACY (Review Request → Referral)
```

### Lead Magnet Ideas by Business Type

Lead magnets should solve a specific problem or answer a specific question. They should be genuinely useful — not gated content that could be a blog post.

| Business Type | Lead Magnet Ideas |
|---|---|
| **Financial Planner** | Retirement readiness calculator, "10 FERS mistakes" PDF, benefits comparison worksheet |
| **Home Services** | Seasonal maintenance checklist, cost estimator tool, "questions to ask before hiring" guide |
| **Legal** | "What to do after [event]" guide, rights checklist, timeline worksheet |
| **Healthcare** | Symptom assessment quiz, preparation guide, insurance coverage checker |
| **Real Estate** | Home valuation tool, neighborhood comparison guide, buyer/seller timeline |
| **B2B Services** | ROI calculator, industry benchmark report, audit checklist |

**Format options:**
- **PDF guide** (easiest to create, 5-15 pages)
- **Interactive calculator/quiz** (highest conversion, requires development)
- **Video series** (high perceived value, good for complex topics)
- **Checklist/worksheet** (quick to consume, high utility)
- **Email course** (drip-delivered over 5-7 days, builds habit of opening your emails)

### Landing Page Requirements

Each lead magnet needs a dedicated landing page:
- Clear headline stating the benefit (not the format)
- 3-5 bullet points of what they'll learn/get
- Minimal form fields (name + email, phone optional)
- Social proof (testimonial, number of downloads, trust badges)
- No navigation menu (reduce distractions)
- Mobile-optimized (60%+ of local traffic is mobile)
- Thank you page with next step CTA (book a call, check email, etc.)

**Target:** Landing page conversion rate of 20-40% (compared to ~2-5% for a general contact page).

### Conversion Path Mapping

For each service, map the complete conversion path:

```
[Blog Post: "How to Choose a Financial Planner"]
    → CTA: "Download our retirement readiness checklist"
        → Landing Page → Email Capture
            → Email Sequence (5-7 emails over 2-3 weeks)
                → Final CTA: "Book a free consultation"
                    → Consultation → Client
```

Include these conversion paths when planning service pages and blog content. Every piece of content should have a clear "next step" — whether that's a lead magnet, a contact form, or a phone call.

### Integration with Content Calendar

When building the content calendar (see above), tag each content piece with its funnel stage:
- **Top of funnel (TOFU):** Blog posts answering questions, social media education
- **Middle of funnel (MOFU):** Lead magnets, comparison guides, case studies
- **Bottom of funnel (BOFU):** Service pages, testimonials, pricing, consultation CTAs

A healthy content mix is roughly 50% TOFU, 30% MOFU, 20% BOFU.

## Email Marketing Strategy

### Context

Email marketing is a high-ROI channel for local businesses with longer consideration cycles. It converts captured leads into customers and past customers into repeat buyers and referral sources.

**This skill does NOT generate email sequences.** Email campaign creation, copywriting, and automation setup should be handled by dedicated email marketing skills or tools. This section covers when and why to recommend email as a strategic option and how it fits into the broader local SEO content strategy.

> **Handoff note:** If an email marketing strategy is recommended as a top priority, advise the user to use dedicated email campaign skills or tools (e.g., Claude email copywriting prompts, ActiveCampaign, Mailchimp, or n8n email automation workflows) for the actual sequence creation.

### When to Recommend Email Marketing

**High priority (recommend proactively):**
- Professional services with 2+ week sales cycles (financial planning, legal, consulting)
- Businesses with repeat customers (dentist, salon, auto repair)
- Businesses already capturing leads but not nurturing them
- Businesses with lead magnets or downloadable content

**Medium priority (mention as option):**
- Service businesses with shorter cycles but high lifetime value
- Businesses with seasonal demand (landscaping, HVAC, tax prep)
- Businesses wanting to reactivate past customers

**Low priority (only if asked):**
- Emergency/immediate-need services (locksmith, tow truck, plumber for emergencies)
- Businesses with no existing email list and no lead capture mechanism
- Very small businesses with <50 contacts

### Email Sequence Types for Local Businesses

| Sequence Type | Trigger | Purpose | Typical Length |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Welcome/Nurture** | Lead magnet download | Build trust, educate, drive consultation | 5-7 emails over 2-3 weeks |
| **Post-Consultation Follow-up** | After consultation/quote | Overcome objections, reinforce value | 3-5 emails over 1-2 weeks |
| **Post-Service** | After service completed | Request review, referral, cross-sell | 3-4 emails over 2-4 weeks |
| **Re-engagement** | Inactive customer (6+ months) | Win back, seasonal reminder, special offer | 3 emails over 2 weeks |
| **Seasonal/Maintenance** | Recurring schedule | Remind about annual/seasonal services | 1-2 emails per season |
| **Newsletter** | Monthly/bi-weekly | Stay top of mind, share content, promotions | Ongoing |

### Email + SEO Synergy

Email marketing amplifies local SEO efforts:
- **Drive traffic to new content** — Email subscribers to new blog posts increases early engagement signals
- **Generate reviews** — Post-service email sequences with review request links
- **Amplify GBP posts** — Share GBP offers/events via email for broader reach
- **Build backlinks** — Share original research/guides with industry contacts who may link to them
- **Increase return visits** — Newsletter drives repeat site visits, improving behavioral signals

### Implementation Recommendations

**Tools (budget-conscious):**
- **Free tier:** Mailchimp (500 contacts), MailerLite (1,000 contacts), Brevo (300 emails/day)
- **n8n automation:** Build custom email sequences with unlimited sends via SMTP (more complex but free at scale)
- **ActivePieces:** Lifetime deal, can handle email automation workflows

**Quick start:**
1. Set up email capture on the website (lead magnet or newsletter signup)
2. Create a welcome sequence (5-7 emails)
3. Create a post-service review request sequence (3-4 emails)
4. Set up a monthly newsletter template
5. Automate via n8n or email platform

**Measurement:**
- Open rate benchmark: 30-40% for local businesses (higher than e-commerce)
- Click rate benchmark: 3-5%
- Unsubscribe rate: < 0.5% per send
- Track: email-attributed leads, review completions from email links, website traffic from email
