# Local SEO Content Strategy Skill

Plan and execute ongoing content that builds topical authority, supports local rankings, and drives leads. In 2026, content differentiation (writing what competitors haven't) matters more than volume.

## Content Priorities (2026)

### What Works
- Commercial/transactional intent keywords (less affected by AI Overviews)
- Original research, proprietary data, real case studies
- **Customer stories with full narratives** (highest-performing content type — see Tier 3a)
- Content competitors haven't written (differentiation > copying)
- Answers to specific "People Also Ask" queries
- Scannable format: H2/H3s, short paragraphs, direct answers
- Tools, calculators, interactive content (AI can't replicate these)
- Video content (YouTube + embedded, increases dwell time)
- First-party experience signals (E-E-A-T)
- **Real photos of people, actual work, and real results** (383-image study: people photos convert best, infographics get most clicks; AI-generated images showed initial gains then declined)

### What's Declining
- Thin "what is X" informational articles (AI answers these directly, CTR down 15-40%)
- Generic content that matches what top competitors already have
- Keyword-stuffed articles without unique angle
- Guest posts on low-quality sites

## Content Type Framework

### Tier 1: Service & Conversion Pages (Create First)
- Dedicated page per service
- Target commercial intent keywords
- 1,500-2,500 words
- Direct business impact
- See: local-seo-service-page skill

### Tier 2: Service Area Pages (Create Second)
- Location-specific pages with unique content
- Target "[service] [city]" keywords
- 1,200-1,800 words
- See: local-seo-area-page skill

### Tier 3: Blog/Resource Content (Ongoing)
- Answer real customer questions
- Target long-tail and KGR keywords
- 1,000-2,000 words (guideline, not KPI — shorter is fine if it answers the question fully)
- Build topical authority
- Content that competitors haven't written

### Tier 3a: Customer Stories (HIGH PRIORITY)
Customer stories dramatically outperform all other content types. These are NOT short testimonials — they're full narratives with specific details. Tested results: +57% conversions (dentist), +350% traffic (painter), outperformed AI content head-to-head.

**How to create:** Interview customers. Cover: the problem, why they chose you, what happened during service, the outcome. Include real photos, actual costs, and timeframes. 200-400 words per story. Add to service pages AND as standalone blog posts.

### Tier 3b: "Honest Review" Pages (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
Create review pages for tools, products, or vendors relevant to your industry. Adding "honest" to title tags produced +58% to +264% traffic increases in tests. Title format: "[Brand Name] Honest Review — [Your Take]". Works best for businesses that use identifiable tools/brands (agencies, consultants, SaaS). Less applicable for pure service businesses (plumber, painter) unless reviewing equipment or suppliers.

### Tier 3c: Interactive Tools
Calculators, quizzes, and assessment tools can rank with minimal or zero text content. If the service involves numbers or decisions, consider a tool instead of (or alongside) a blog post.

### Tier 4: Social & GBP Content (Ongoing)
- GBP posts (2-3/week)
- Social media (platform-dependent)
- Supports engagement and behavioral signals

## Blog Topic Generation Process

### Step 1: Mine for Topics

Sources for content ideas:
- **Customer questions** — What do clients ask during consultations?
- **GSC queries** — What are people searching to find you?
- **Competitor content gaps** — What haven't they written about?
- **"People Also Ask"** — Google's related questions for your keywords
- **Industry forums/Reddit** — Real questions people are asking
- **Seasonal needs** — What changes by season for your business?
- **Local angles** — Local events, regulations, demographics

### Step 2: Evaluate & Prioritize Topics

For each topic, assess:
- Search volume (from keyword research)
- KGR score (quick wins < 0.25)
- Competition level
- Relevance to services you sell
- Likelihood of converting readers to leads
- Can you add unique perspective or data?

### Step 3: Content Calendar Structure

**Recommended cadence:**
- New site: 2-4 blog posts/month (build content base)
- Established site: 1-2 blog posts/month (maintain + refresh)
- GBP posts: 2-3 per week
- Social: Platform-dependent (see below)

## 12-Month Content Plan Template

### Months 1-3: Foundation
- **Focus:** Service pages, core site content, GBP setup
- **Blog:** Answer top 8-12 FAQ questions (KGR opportunities)
- **GBP:** Establish posting cadence, seed Q&A
- **Goal:** Build baseline topical authority

### Months 4-6: Expansion
- **Focus:** Service area pages, comprehensive guides
- **Blog:** Deeper topic exploration, comparison content, "best X for Y" articles
- **GBP:** Consistent posting, photo/video uploads
- **Goal:** Cover primary keyword targets

### Months 7-9: Authority
- **Focus:** Original research, case studies, tools/calculators
- **Blog:** Advanced topics, thought leadership, local expert content
- **GBP:** Share case studies, event announcements
- **Goal:** E-E-A-T signals, differentiation from competitors

### Months 10-12: Optimization
- **Focus:** Refresh top content, seasonal content
- **Blog:** Year-end topics, predictions, trend analysis
- **GBP:** Seasonal promotions, year-in-review
- **Goal:** Maintain rankings, capture seasonal opportunities

## Social Media Strategy

### Platform Selection (Local Business)

| Platform | Best For | Posting Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| **GBP Posts** | All local businesses | 2-3/week (minimum) |
| **Facebook** | Community engagement, local audiences | 3-5/week |
| **LinkedIn** | Professional services (lawyers, financial, healthcare) | 2-3/week |
| **Instagram** | Visual services (home services, food, fitness) | 4-7/week |
| **YouTube** | All (video builds E-E-A-T + dwell time) | 1-2/month |
| **X/Twitter** | Only if already active | Daily or skip entirely |

### Content Mix (80/20 Rule)
- 80% value (educational, helpful, entertaining)
- 20% promotional (services, offers, CTAs)

### Social Post Types
1. **Tips & Education** — Share expertise, answer common questions
2. **Behind-the-Scenes** — Team photos, office culture, day-in-the-life
3. **Case Studies / Results** — Before/after, client outcomes (with permission)
4. **Local Community** — Events, partnerships, sponsorships
5. **Promotions** — Seasonal offers, special pricing
6. **Engagement** — Questions, polls, "ask me anything"
7. **User-Generated** — Share client photos/reviews (with permission)

## Content Refresh Strategy

Review existing content quarterly:

1. **Top performers** (high traffic) — Update with fresh data, expand sections
2. **High impressions, low CTR** — Rewrite meta title and description
3. **Ranking 11-20** — Optimize for target keyword, add internal links, expand content
4. **Underperforming** — Update, consolidate with related content, or remove
5. **All content older than 12 months** — Check for accuracy, update dates

## AI-Optimized Content (AEO/GEO)

To maximize visibility in AI search results (Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, etc.):

1. **Structure for extraction** — Use clear H2/H3 hierarchy with direct answers
2. **Answer questions directly** — Don't bury answers in paragraphs of preamble
3. **Include entity information** — Business name, location, credentials, years of experience
4. **Cite sources** — Reference authoritative data when making claims
5. **Keep it concise** — AI favors scannable, no-fluff content
6. **First-party data** — Include original statistics, research, or proprietary insights
7. **Update regularly** — AI systems prefer recently updated content
