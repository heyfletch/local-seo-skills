# Citation & Directory Strategy

## Context

Citations (mentions of NAP — Name, Address, Phone — across the web) account for ~7% of local pack ranking factors and ~13% of AI search visibility. While declining in direct ranking impact, citations remain important for:
- AI search engines (ChatGPT uses Bing, Yelp, BBB, Foursquare — NOT Google)
- Entity validation (Google triangulates business identity across sources)
- "Best of" list placement (LLMs heavily cite these for recommendations)
- Trust signals for new businesses establishing credibility

**Diminishing returns:** Focus on the top 30-50 directories. After that, additional citations provide minimal benefit. Quality and accuracy > quantity.

## NAP Consistency Standard

Before submitting anywhere, establish the canonical NAP format:

```
Business Name: [Exact legal name — no keyword stuffing]
Address: [Full street address with suite/unit if applicable]
Phone: [Local number preferred over toll-free]
Website: [https://www.domain.com — consistent trailing slash policy]
```

**Rules:**
- Use the EXACT same format everywhere (no abbreviations on some, spelled out on others)
- "Street" vs "St." — pick one and use it everywhere
- Suite vs Ste. vs # — pick one format
- If SAB (service area business), follow each platform's rules for hiding address
- Document this in the client profile for anyone touching citations

## Directory Tiers

### Tier 1: Must-Have (Complete within first 2 weeks)

These are the directories that directly feed AI search engines, Google's entity graph, or have significant domain authority.

| Directory | Why It Matters | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Google Business Profile | 32% of local pack weight | Day 1 |
| Bing Places | ChatGPT's primary data source | Day 1 |
| Apple Maps (Apple Business Connect) | Siri, Apple Maps, CarPlay | Week 1 |
| Facebook Business Page | Social proof + AI data source | Week 1 |
| Yelp | ChatGPT data source, high DA backlink | Week 1 |
| BBB (Better Business Bureau) | AI search references, trust signal | Week 1-2 |
| Yellow Pages (YP.com) | Data aggregator feed | Week 1-2 |
| Foursquare | Feeds multiple AI/apps | Week 1-2 |

### Tier 2: Important (Complete within first month)

| Directory | Why It Matters |
|---|---|
| Nextdoor | Local community trust, hyperlocal |
| Angi (formerly Angie's List) | Home services especially |
| Thumbtack | Service businesses, lead gen |
| Manta | Business directory, DA 70+ |
| Hotfrog | Free, quick listing |
| MapQuest | Navigation feeds |
| ChamberOfCommerce.com | Business credibility |
| Local Chamber of Commerce | Local trust signal + backlink |

### Tier 3: Industry-Specific (Higher value than general NAP in 2026)

Industry-specific directories are MORE valuable than general directories for both traditional and AI search. LLMs preferentially cite industry-specific sources.

**Healthcare:** Healthgrades, Zocdoc, Vitals, WebMD, RateMDs
**Legal:** Avvo, FindLaw, Justia, Lawyers.com, Martindale
**Home Services:** HomeAdvisor, Houzz, Porch, BuildZoom
**Financial:** NAPFA, CFP Board, SmartAsset, WealthManagement.com
**Restaurants:** TripAdvisor, OpenTable, Zomato
**Automotive:** CarFax, RepairPal, AutoMD
**Real Estate:** Zillow, Realtor.com, Trulia
**Pet Services:** Rover, BringFido, PetSit
**Fitness/Wellness:** ClassPass, Mindbody

### Tier 4: Data Aggregators (Feed hundreds of smaller directories)

Submitting to these feeds your NAP to hundreds of downstream sites:

| Aggregator | Feeds |
|---|---|
| Data Axle (formerly Infogroup) | 100+ directories |
| Neustar Localeze | 50+ directories |
| Foursquare (already in Tier 1) | Navigation apps, social apps |

## "Best Of" List Strategy (AI Visibility)

LLMs heavily cite "Best [Service] in [City]" articles when answering local queries. This is separate from directory citations.

**Actions:**
1. Search "[service] in [city]" on Google — identify which "best of" lists rank in top 10
2. Check if the business is listed on those pages
3. If not listed, look for submission/nomination processes
4. Some are paid (Expertise.com, Three Best Rated) — evaluate ROI
5. Create or claim profiles on platforms that generate these lists (Yelp, Expertise, etc.)
6. Consider digital PR to get featured in local publication "best of" roundups

## Submission Timeline

**Week 1:** Tier 1 directories (Google, Bing, Apple, Facebook, Yelp)
**Week 2:** Remaining Tier 1 (BBB, YP, Foursquare) + start Tier 2
**Week 3-4:** Complete Tier 2 + industry-specific Tier 3
**Month 2:** Data aggregators + "Best Of" list submissions
**Ongoing:** Monitor for duplicate listings quarterly, fix NAP inconsistencies as found

**Spacing:** Do NOT submit to 30 directories in one day. Spread submissions over 2-4 weeks to appear natural.

## Duplicate Detection & Cleanup

Before creating new listings, search each platform for existing listings:
- Search business name + city
- Search phone number
- Search address
- Claim or merge duplicates rather than creating new ones
- Some platforms charge for claiming (BBB, Yelp advertising upsells) — the free listing is sufficient for citation value

## Tracking

Maintain a spreadsheet or tracker with:
- Directory name
- URL of listing
- Date submitted
- Date live/verified
- NAP verified correct (Y/N)
- Last checked date
- Notes (login credentials stored separately in password manager)

For agency clients, BrightLocal automates citation tracking and discovery. For DIY, a simple spreadsheet works.
