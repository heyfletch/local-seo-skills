# Traffic Projections

## CTR by Position

| Position | Average CTR |
|---|---|
| 1 | 25-30% |
| 2 | 15-20% |
| 3 | 10-15% |
| 4-5 | 7-10% |
| 6-10 | 3-7% |
| 11-20 | 1-3% |

## Calculation Formula

**Per keyword:** Monthly Volume × CTR at Target Position = Potential Monthly Clicks

## Adjustment Factors

- New domain (DA <20): ×0.5-0.7
- Established domain (DA 20-40): ×0.7-0.9
- Low competition market: ×1.0-1.2
- High competition: ×0.5-0.8

## 3-Interval Projection Methodology

Project at 3 intervals:

- **3 months** (10-20% of full potential) — quick wins, KGR keywords
- **6 months** (30-50%) — service pages ranking, some blog traction
- **12 months** (60-80%) — established authority, local pack presence

Always state whether projections are for local pack, local organic, or combined. Communicate conservative scenario to clients.

## 2026 Context

**SERP Reality:** Ads are compressing organic space. LSAs capture ~5% CTR average (20%+ for high-trust verticals like lawyers). Map pack: mid-teens CTR per position. First organic result: low-to-mid twenties (down from 30%+). Consider recommending a paid ads partner for clients in LSA-heavy industries.

**AI Search Reality Check:** ChatGPT has <1% of daily searches and drives <1% of referral traffic. Most prompts are not search behavior. For local businesses, AI queries with local intent trigger web search (RAG) behind the scenes — so ranking well in traditional search drives AI visibility too. Use AI buzz as a conversation starter with clients, but deliver solid local SEO fundamentals.

## 90-Day Action Plan Template

### Weeks 1-2: Foundation
- GBP claim/verify and optimize (categories, services, description, photos)
- Set up GA4, GSC, rank tracking
- Implement schema markup on homepage
- Fix critical technical issues (speed, mobile, SSL)
- Set up GA4 funnel explorations: track journey from blog/service page → conversion page → form submission (use open funnels, not closed; proves SEO drives business outcomes, not just traffic)
- Create NAP consistency document

### Weeks 3-4: Core Content
- Create/optimize top 3-5 service pages
- Optimize homepage with primary keywords
- Add reviews page (title: "[Brand Name] Reviews" — NOT "Testimonials")
- Set up review generation system
- **Entity consistency check:** Google the brand, ask ChatGPT "Who is [brand]?" — fix inconsistencies across website, GBP, LinkedIn, directories
- Begin collecting customer stories (interview 2-3 clients for full narratives with photos/costs/outcomes)

### Weeks 5-8: Expansion
- Create remaining service pages
- Build 2-3 highest-priority service area pages (with unique content)
- Publish 4-6 blog posts targeting KGR keywords
- Begin citation building (Tier 1 directories)
- Start GBP posting cadence (2-3/week)
- Set up post-publish validation signals: indexation within 48 hours (GSC URL Inspection), impression growth tracking (impressions predict future click growth), user behavior monitoring (Microsoft Clarity for scroll depth and engagement)

### Weeks 9-12: Authority
- Complete citation building (Tier 2)
- Continue blog content (4-6 more posts)
- Build 2-3 more service area pages
- Start local link building (chambers, associations)
- Monthly performance review and adjustment
- Multi-site brand presence — ensure business is mentioned across top directory listings, "Best [Service] in [City]" articles, and industry publications (LLMs synthesize from multiple sources, not just your website)
