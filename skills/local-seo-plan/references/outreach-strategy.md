# Outreach & Partnership Strategy

## Context

Links account for ~12% of local pack and ~24% of local organic ranking factors. While declining for local pack, link building remains the second-most important factor for local organic results. For local businesses, the highest-value links come from local and industry sources — not generic guest posts.

**Key principle:** Local link building is relationship building. The best links come from real partnerships, not cold outreach to random blogs. Focus on connections the business already has or could naturally develop.

## Local Partnership Types

### 1. Complementary Business Partnerships (Highest ROI)

Find businesses that serve the same customer at a different stage or for a different need:

| Business Type | Natural Partners |
|---|---|
| Dentist | Orthodontist, pediatrician, cosmetic surgeon |
| Plumber | Real estate agent, home inspector, general contractor |
| Financial planner | CPA, estate attorney, insurance agent |
| Dog trainer | Veterinarian, pet store, groomer |
| Landscaper | Real estate agent, pool company, fence installer |
| Restaurant | Event planner, hotel, local brewery |

**What to offer:**
- Mutual website links (resources/partners page)
- Joint blog content ("Our Recommended Partners for [Service]")
- Co-hosted events or workshops
- Cross-referral system with tracking
- Joint social media content or giveaways

### 2. Local Organizations & Associations

| Organization Type | Link Opportunity |
|---|---|
| Chamber of Commerce | Member directory listing (often DA 40-60) |
| Rotary/Lions/Kiwanis | Sponsor or member page |
| Local business associations | Member profile with backlink |
| Industry trade associations | Member directory, speaker/author bio |
| School PTAs/Booster clubs | Sponsor page |
| Youth sports leagues | Sponsor page |
| Local nonprofits | Sponsor/partner page |

**Action:** Identify 5-10 organizations the business already belongs to or could join. Check each for a member directory with website links. Membership fees typically $200-500/year — worth it for the link + networking alone.

### 3. Local Media & Publications

| Source | Link Type |
|---|---|
| Local newspaper website | Press mention, expert quote, contributed article |
| Local business journal | Feature story, "Best of" nomination |
| Local blogs/influencers | Sponsored content, review, feature |
| Neighborhood newsletters (Patch, etc.) | Event listings, community news |
| Local podcasts | Guest appearance with show notes link |
| University/college publications | Expert source, career features |

**How to get featured:**
- Sign up for HARO/Connectively/SourceOfSources for journalist queries
- Send press releases for genuine news (new location, milestone, award, community event)
- Offer expert commentary on industry topics relevant to local reporters
- Sponsor or host community events (creates natural press coverage)

### 4. Event-Based Link Building

| Event Type | Link Sources |
|---|---|
| Host a workshop/seminar | Event pages, registration sites, attendee blogs |
| Sponsor a local event | Event website sponsor page, social mentions |
| Participate in trade shows | Exhibitor directory, recap articles |
| Community service/cleanup | Local news coverage, organization websites |
| Charity partnerships | Nonprofit website, press coverage |

**Strategy:** One meaningful local event per quarter generates 5-15 natural links from event listings, press coverage, partner sites, and attendee mentions.

## Link Building Tactics (Ranked by Local Value)

### Priority A: Existing Relationships (Do First)

1. **Audit existing partnerships** — Does the business already have vendor, supplier, or partner relationships? Check if those sites link back. If not, ask.
2. **Supplier/vendor pages** — Many suppliers have "find a dealer" or "certified installer" directories. Claim listings.
3. **Professional certifications** — Licensing boards, certification bodies often have member directories with links.
4. **Alumni networks** — College/university alumni pages, especially if the owner is active.
5. **Client testimonials** — Offer to provide testimonials for tools/services the business uses. Most companies link back to the testimonial author's business.

### Priority B: Earned Media (Ongoing)

6. **"Best of" list submissions** — See citation-strategy.md for detailed approach
7. **Local scholarship** — Create a small scholarship ($500-1,000/year). .edu links from scholarship directories are extremely valuable. Less effective than it used to be but still works for genuine programs.
8. **Expert roundup participation** — Search "[industry] expert roundup" or "[industry] tips" and pitch to be included
9. **Data/research creation** — Original local data (surveys, market reports) naturally attracts links from journalists and bloggers

### Priority C: Content-Driven (When Resources Allow)

10. **Guest posting on local sites** — Write for the local business journal, chamber blog, or industry publications. Focus on genuinely useful content, not thin SEO posts.
11. **Resource page link building** — Find local resource pages ("Best resources for [topic] in [city]") and request inclusion
12. **Broken link building** — Find broken links on local sites that point to content similar to what the client has. Offer the client's page as a replacement.

## Competitor Backlink Analysis

Use Ahrefs or DataForSEO to pull competitor backlink profiles:

1. Export referring domains for top 3-5 competitors
2. Filter for local and industry-relevant links
3. Identify links the client doesn't have
4. Prioritize by DA and relevance
5. Determine acquisition method for each (join organization, claim listing, outreach, etc.)

This turns competitor research into a link building task list.
