# Local SEO — Google Business Profile Skill

GBP drives 32% of local pack ranking weight and is often the highest-ROI activity for local businesses. This skill covers complete optimization, posting strategy, and Q&A management.

## GBP Optimization Checklist

### Profile Foundation

```
☐ Business name (EXACTLY as on storefront/legal docs — no keyword stuffing)
☐ Primary category (most specific: "Optometrist" not "Eye Care Center")
☐ Secondary categories (up to 9 relevant categories added)
☐ Business description (750 chars max):
   - Primary keywords naturally included
   - Service area mentioned
   - Key differentiators
   - Call-to-action
☐ Service area defined (if SAB) or address visible (if storefront)
☐ Phone number (local number preferred)
☐ Website URL
☐ Appointment URL
☐ Accurate business hours (including special/holiday hours)
☐ All applicable attributes selected
☐ Opening date set
```

### GBP Predefined Services ⚠️ CRITICAL 2026

Adding Google-suggested services directly impacts keyword rankings.

```
☐ Review Google's suggested services for your category
☐ Add ALL relevant predefined services
☐ Each service needs:
   - Name (use Google's suggestion or close match)
   - Description (300 chars — include keyword variations)
   - Price (if applicable — even "varies" or "starting at $X")
   - Link to relevant website page
☐ Cross-reference with the master services list for the business
```

### Photos & Video

```
☐ Profile photo (logo or building, square)
☐ Cover photo (branded, landscape)
☐ Exterior photos (multiple angles, including signage)
☐ Interior photos (office, workspace, waiting area)
☐ Team photos (individual headshots + group)
☐ At-work photos (service being performed)
☐ Before/after photos (if applicable)

Targets:
- Minimum 10 photos at launch
- Add 5-10 new photos monthly
- Include video content weekly (increases profile dwell time — a rising ranking factor)
- All photos: high-quality, well-lit, properly oriented, 720px+ width
```

### "Open Now" Optimization ⚠️ NEW 2026

Google now heavily prioritizes businesses that are currently open.

```
☐ Hours are 100% accurate
☐ Holiday hours set for ALL upcoming holidays
☐ Consider extending hours if feasible (rankings slip ~1 hour before closing)
☐ If 24/7 online booking, consider setting extended hours
☐ Monitor ranking changes around opening/closing times
```

### Map Pin Monitoring

```
☐ Verify pin is correctly placed on map
☐ Set up monthly check for pin location
☐ Competitors or "helpful users" can suggest edits to move your pin
☐ Report any unauthorized pin changes immediately
```

## GBP Posting Strategy

### Post Types & Mix

- **Updates** (40%) — Educational tips, insights, announcements
- **Offers** (30%) — Promotions, specials, seasonal deals
- **Events** (20%) — Workshops, webinars, community events
- **Products** (10%) — Product/package highlights (if applicable)

### Posting Schedule

- **Frequency:** 2-3 posts per week minimum
- **Best days:** Tuesday-Thursday (higher engagement)
- **Best times:** 9am-12pm in the business's local timezone (confirm timezone with client; default to ET if unknown)
- **Max length:** 1,500 chars (300-500 chars ideal for engagement)

### Batch Planning Workflow

Instead of deciding what to post each week (which causes decision fatigue and inconsistency), plan the entire month in one sitting:

1. **Set a primary monthly goal** (e.g., "Increase inbound calls by showcasing seasonal services")
2. **Define a primary offer/focus** for the month
3. **Assign weekly themes:**
   - Week 1: Seasonal/educational awareness
   - Week 2: Service highlight
   - Week 3: Social proof (testimonials, project photos)
   - Week 4: Offers and conversion push
4. **Batch-write all 4+ posts** in one session
5. **Review together, then schedule** all at once

For agencies managing multiple clients: batch by client in dedicated sessions. First few times may take 2 hours per location, but gets faster with practice. Can batch 2-3+ months ahead.

### Post Template

```
[Engaging opening line or question — hook the reader]

[2-3 sentences of VALUE — tip, insight, or useful information]

[Call-to-action — specific next step]

[Link to relevant website page]

[High-quality image — required for engagement]
```

### Sample Post Calendar (1 Month)

Generate 12-16 posts per month using this mix:

**Week 1:**
- Mon: Educational tip related to core service
- Wed: Seasonal offer or promotion
- Fri: Behind-the-scenes team photo/video

**Week 2:**
- Tue: FAQ answer (mirrors a common search query)
- Thu: Customer success story (anonymized if needed)

**Week 3:**
- Mon: Service spotlight (highlight a specific offering)
- Wed: Local community involvement or event
- Fri: Industry news or insight

**Week 4:**
- Tue: Before/after or case study
- Thu: Special offer with urgency
- Sat: Team or culture highlight

### Post Content Generation Prompt

```
Create [X] Google Business Profile posts for [Business Name], a [business type] in [city].

Post mix: 2 educational, 2 promotional, 1 engagement
Current month: [month] — incorporate seasonal relevance
Target services to highlight: [list]

For each post include:
- Type: Update / Offer / Event
- Content: 300-500 characters, value-driven, keyword-aware
- CTA: Specific action (Call Now, Learn More, Book Now)
- CTA URL: [relevant page]
- Image suggestion
- Best publish time
```

## Q&A Strategy

### Seed Questions (Create 5-10)

Ask and answer the questions potential customers would ask:

```
☐ "What does [service] cost?"
☐ "How long does [service] take?"
☐ "Do you serve [city/area]?"
☐ "What insurance do you accept?" (if applicable)
☐ "Do you offer free consultations?"
☐ "Are you licensed/certified?"
☐ "What are your hours?"
☐ "Do you offer [specific service variant]?"
☐ [2-3 industry-specific questions]
```

### Q&A Best Practices

- Answer your own questions thoroughly (include keywords naturally)
- Monitor daily for new questions from public
- Respond to all questions within 24 hours
- Upvote helpful questions
- Use answers to highlight differentiators
- Link to relevant website pages in answers when appropriate

## GBP Messaging

```
☐ Enable messaging
☐ Set welcome message: "Thanks for reaching out to [Business]! We typically respond within [X hours]. How can we help you?"
☐ Respond within 24 hours (response time affects visibility)
☐ Create saved replies for common questions
☐ Assign messaging monitoring to team member
```

## Multi-Location GBP Management

For businesses with multiple locations:

- Each location needs its OWN verified GBP
- Each GBP needs unique photos (not the same set across locations)
- Each GBP needs location-specific posts
- Each GBP needs its own review generation stream
- Primary category should be consistent across locations
- Secondary categories can vary by location if services differ
- Service descriptions should reference the specific location
- Consider using a GBP management tool for 5+ locations

### Expanding Map Pack Radius via Sublease Offices

Service area pages help local organic rankings but will NOT help map pack rankings — only GBP proximity does that. For clients who need map pack presence in another city, consider subleasing office space:

- Find someone on Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist renting a room in their existing office — usually hundreds/month vs thousands for a full lease
- Requirements for GBP guidelines: should have signage and technically should be staffed
- Many businesses staff only for initial video verification, then operate "by appointment only"
- This is a legitimate strategy commonly used by law firms and insurance companies
- Each new location needs its own verified GBP, unique photos, and location-specific content

## Local Services Ads (LSA) Considerations

For industries where LSAs are available (plumbers, HVAC, lawyers, etc.):

1. **Review recency** matters more than total volume for LSA ranking
2. **Response time** to calls/messages is a top-tier LSA ranking factor
3. **Call quality** — Google AI transcribes calls; poor handling lowers visibility
4. LSAs capture up to 70% of lead volume in some industries
5. LSA ads now appear on 31% of tracked queries (up from 11% at start of 2025)

**LSA Management as a Service:**
- Near Media research shows consumers often don't recognize LSAs as ads, making them highly effective
- Map pack leads/calls are declining in industries where LSAs are active — LSAs capture attention first
- Industry ROI varies significantly: personal injury lawyers ($500/lead, usually worth it), plumbers ($50-100/lead, depends on job size)
- Part of effective LSA management includes listening to calls and coaching clients on closing leads — Google AI transcribes calls and poor handling lowers LSA visibility
- Google's system for disputing bad leads is limited — factor this into ROI calculations
- Consider offering LSA setup and management as an add-on service for applicable industries
