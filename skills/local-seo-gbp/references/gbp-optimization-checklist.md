# GBP Optimization Checklist

## Profile Foundation

```
☐ Business name (EXACTLY as on storefront/legal docs — no keyword stuffing)
☐ Primary category (most specific: "Optometrist" not "Eye Care Center")
☐ Secondary categories (up to 9 relevant categories added)
☐ Business description (750 chars max):
   - Primary keywords naturally included
   - Service area mentioned
   - Key differentiators
   - Call-to-action
☐ Service area defined (if SAB) or address visible (if storefront)
☐ Phone number (local number preferred)
☐ Website URL
☐ Appointment URL
☐ Accurate business hours (including special/holiday hours)
☐ All applicable attributes selected
☐ Opening date set
```

## GBP Predefined Services (CRITICAL 2026)

Adding Google-suggested services directly impacts keyword rankings.

```
☐ Review Google's suggested services for your category
☐ Add ALL relevant predefined services
☐ Each service needs:
   - Name (use Google's suggestion or close match)
   - Description (300 chars — include keyword variations)
   - Price (if applicable — even "varies" or "starting at $X")
   - Link to relevant website page
☐ Cross-reference with the master services list for the business
```

## Photos & Video

```
☐ Profile photo (logo or building, square)
☐ Cover photo (branded, landscape)
☐ Exterior photos (multiple angles, including signage)
☐ Interior photos (office, workspace, waiting area)
☐ Team photos (individual headshots + group)
☐ At-work photos (service being performed)
☐ Before/after photos (if applicable)

Targets:
- Minimum 10 photos at launch
- Add 5-10 new photos monthly
- Include video content weekly (increases profile dwell time — a rising ranking factor)
- All photos: high-quality, well-lit, properly oriented, 720px+ width
```

## "Open Now" Optimization (NEW 2026)

Google now heavily prioritizes businesses that are currently open.

```
☐ Hours are 100% accurate
☐ Holiday hours set for ALL upcoming holidays
☐ Consider extending hours if feasible (rankings slip ~1 hour before closing)
☐ If 24/7 online booking, consider setting extended hours
☐ Monitor ranking changes around opening/closing times
```

## Map Pin Monitoring

```
☐ Verify pin is correctly placed on map
☐ Set up monthly check for pin location
☐ Competitors or "helpful users" can suggest edits to move your pin
☐ Report any unauthorized pin changes immediately
```

## GBP Messaging

```
☐ Enable messaging
☐ Set welcome message: "Thanks for reaching out to [Business]! We typically respond within [X hours]. How can we help you?"
☐ Respond within 24 hours (response time affects visibility)
☐ Create saved replies for common questions
☐ Assign messaging monitoring to team member
```

## Multi-Location GBP Management

For businesses with multiple locations:

- Each location needs its OWN verified GBP
- Each GBP needs unique photos (not the same set across locations)
- Each GBP needs location-specific posts
- Each GBP needs its own review generation stream
- Primary category should be consistent across locations
- Secondary categories can vary by location if services differ
- Service descriptions should reference the specific location
- Consider using a GBP management tool for 5+ locations

### Expanding Map Pack Radius via Sublease Offices

Service area pages help local organic rankings but will NOT help map pack rankings — only GBP proximity does that. For clients who need map pack presence in another city, consider subleasing office space:

- Find someone on Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist renting a room in their existing office — usually hundreds/month vs thousands for a full lease
- Requirements for GBP guidelines: should have signage and technically should be staffed
- Many businesses staff only for initial video verification, then operate "by appointment only"
- This is a legitimate strategy commonly used by law firms and insurance companies
- Each new location needs its own verified GBP, unique photos, and location-specific content

## Local Services Ads (LSA) Considerations

For industries where LSAs are available (plumbers, HVAC, lawyers, etc.):

1. **Review recency** matters more than total volume for LSA ranking
2. **Response time** to calls/messages is a top-tier LSA ranking factor
3. **Call quality** — Google AI transcribes calls; poor handling lowers visibility
4. LSAs capture up to 70% of lead volume in some industries
5. LSA ads now appear on 31% of tracked queries (up from 11% at start of 2025)

### LSA Management as a Service
- Near Media research shows consumers often don't recognize LSAs as ads, making them highly effective
- Map pack leads/calls are declining in industries where LSAs are active — LSAs capture attention first
- Industry ROI varies significantly: personal injury lawyers ($500/lead, usually worth it), plumbers ($50-100/lead, depends on job size)
- Part of effective LSA management includes listening to calls and coaching clients on closing leads — Google AI transcribes calls and poor handling lowers LSA visibility
- Google's system for disputing bad leads is limited — factor this into ROI calculations
- Consider offering LSA setup and management as an add-on service for applicable industries
