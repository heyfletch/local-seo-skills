# Monthly Retainer Execution Checklist

## Purpose

When delivering ongoing monthly SEO services, this is the execution workflow for each client each month. Use this as the standard operating procedure for the Care Phase (Phase 3) of agency delivery.

## Weekly Cadence

### Every Week

- [ ] **GBP posting** — Publish 2-3 GBP posts per the monthly content plan
- [ ] **Review monitoring** — Check Google, Yelp, Facebook for new reviews. Respond to all within 24 hours.
- [ ] **Review generation** — Send 2-5 review requests to recent customers (steady pace, never bursts)
- [ ] **Quick check** — Glance at GSC for crawl errors, manual actions, or security issues
- [ ] **Client communication** — Proactive update if anything notable happened (new ranking, review, competitor move)

### Time Budget per Client per Week
- Foundation tier ($500-800/mo): ~2-3 hours/week
- Growth tier ($1,000-1,500/mo): ~4-5 hours/week
- Authority tier ($1,500-2,500/mo): ~6-8 hours/week

## Monthly Execution (In Order)

### Week 1: Reporting & Planning

**Day 1-2: Pull data and build report**
- [ ] Export GSC data: impressions, clicks, CTR, avg position for target keywords
- [ ] Export GA4 data: organic sessions, goal completions, top landing pages
- [ ] Check GBP Insights: views, searches, actions, photo views, direction requests
- [ ] Pull rank tracking data (BrightLocal or GSC)
- [ ] Compare to previous month and 3 months ago
- [ ] Note wins to highlight (even small ones — "moved from page 3 to page 2 for [keyword]")
- [ ] Draft monthly report

**Day 3: Strategic planning for the month**
- [ ] Review last month's action items — what was completed, what carried over?
- [ ] Identify this month's priority tasks based on the roadmap
- [ ] Plan content pieces for the month (blog posts, service page updates, GBP posts)
- [ ] Check for seasonal opportunities (holidays, events, industry trends)
- [ ] Set 2-3 specific goals for the month

**Day 4-5: Client report delivery**
- [ ] Send monthly report with: wins highlighted, work completed, next month's plan
- [ ] Optional: 15-30 min call to walk through the report
- [ ] Document any new client requests or direction changes

### Week 2: Content & On-Page

- [ ] **Content creation** — Write/publish blog posts, update service pages, or create new pages per the roadmap
- [ ] **On-page optimization** — Update title tags, meta descriptions, internal links based on latest keyword data
- [ ] **Service page refresh** — If on a refresh cycle, update the next service page in rotation (~30% content change, title/H1/H2 updates)
- [ ] **Image optimization** — Add new photos (real, not AI-generated), optimize alt text
- [ ] **Schema updates** — Add or update structured data if new pages were created

### Week 3: Off-Page & Authority

- [ ] **Citation maintenance** — Check top 10 citations for NAP accuracy (monthly rotation through the full list)
- [ ] **New citations** — Submit to 2-3 new directories if still building out the citation profile
- [ ] **Link building** — Execute 1-2 outreach activities (partnership, local organization, content pitch)
- [ ] **Competitor check** — Quick scan of top 3 competitors for new content, new reviews, ranking changes
- [ ] **Social media** — Schedule next month's social content (if in scope)

### Week 4: Technical & Optimization

- [ ] **Technical monitoring** — Run quick crawl check (broken links, 404s, redirect chains)
- [ ] **Core Web Vitals** — Monthly check if there were site changes
- [ ] **Content refresh** — Update any content older than 6 months that's ranking 11-20 (improvement opportunity)
- [ ] **Internal linking** — Add 3-5 new internal links from recent content to priority pages
- [ ] **AI visibility check** — Monthly ChatGPT/Gemini brand query spot check
- [ ] **Prepare next month** — Stage content ideas, identify upcoming seasonal opportunities

## Quarterly Deep Dives (Every 3 Months)

In addition to monthly work, schedule these quarterly:

- [ ] **Full competitor analysis refresh** — Have competitors changed strategy? New content? New services?
- [ ] **Keyword research refresh** — New opportunities? Declining keywords to deprioritize?
- [ ] **Strategy adjustment** — Is the current roadmap still the right direction? Pivot if needed.
- [ ] **Content audit** — Which content is performing? Which isn't? Consolidate or update underperformers.
- [ ] **GBP category review** — Have new categories become available? Should secondary categories change?
- [ ] **Review health check** — On track for review velocity targets? Any platform-specific issues?
- [ ] **Client roadmap presentation** — Present next quarter's plan with wins from last quarter

## Monthly Report Template

Structure the monthly report as:

```
1. KEY WINS THIS MONTH
   - [Specific win with data: "Moved to position 4 for 'plumber Dallas' — was position 11 last month"]
   - [Win 2]
   - [Win 3]

2. WORK COMPLETED
   - [Task 1 with specifics]
   - [Task 2]
   - ...

3. PERFORMANCE SNAPSHOT
   - Organic traffic: [X] (vs [Y] last month, [Z] 3 months ago)
   - Keywords in top 10: [X] (vs [Y])
   - GBP views: [X]
   - Reviews this month: [X] new ([Y] total, [Z] avg rating)
   - Leads/conversions: [X] (if tracked)

4. NEXT MONTH'S PLAN
   - Priority 1: [Specific task]
   - Priority 2: [Specific task]
   - Priority 3: [Specific task]

5. RECOMMENDATIONS / DISCUSSION ITEMS
   - [Any strategic suggestions or client decisions needed]
```

**Rule:** Lead with wins. Clients stay when they see progress. Even "we gained 200 new keyword impressions this month" shows movement.

## Red Flags to Watch For

| Signal | What It Means | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Sudden traffic drop (>20%) | Algorithm update, technical issue, or penalty | Investigate immediately, notify client same day |
| GBP suspension | Policy violation or spam report | Appeal immediately, document everything |
| Negative review surge | Unhappy customer campaign or competitor attack | Alert client, draft responses, document if fake |
| Competitor ranking jump | They invested in SEO or got featured | Analyze what changed, adjust strategy |
| Client going quiet | Potential churn signal | Proactive outreach with a quick win or insight |
| Ranking plateau (3+ months) | Strategy needs adjustment | Quarterly deep dive, consider new approach |

## Client Communication Cadence

| Tier | Monthly Report | Calls | Ad-Hoc Updates |
|---|---|---|---|
| Foundation | Written report, email delivery | Quarterly | Major wins or issues only |
| Growth | Written report + 15-min call | Monthly | Weekly email updates |
| Authority | Written report + 30-min call | Monthly | As-needed, Slack/email |

**Rule:** Proactive > reactive. Tell clients what you did before they wonder. A client who has to ask "what have you been doing?" is already considering canceling.
