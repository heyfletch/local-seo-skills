# Agency Service Models

## Model A: SEO Boost (One-Time, Entry Level)

A productized, one-time service ideal for web designers adding SEO or building confidence.

**Includes:**
- 3-5 keywords targeted
- Basic keyword research (free tools only)
- On-page optimization: page titles, meta descriptions, headers, alt text, copy tweaks
- Pages: homepage, services, location, about
- NOT content creation, Google setup, or ongoing management

**Pricing:**
- 3 keywords: $399
- 5 keywords: $499 (starting price) → $999 (goal price)
- 10 keywords: $999-$1,499

**Sell as:** Website project add-on, standalone product, lead-in to monthly services.
**Time to deliver:** 2-5 hours.
**Upsell path:** Include 90-day rank tracking as bonus → demonstrate results → upsell to monthly retainer.

## Model B: Monthly Retainer (Core Agency Model)

Recurring revenue engine. This is where real agency economics live.

| Tier | Includes | Price Range | Client Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| Foundation | GBP management, 1 blog/month, review monitoring, monthly report | $500-$800/mo | Maintenance, very small businesses |
| Growth | + page optimization, citation building, content strategy, keyword tracking | $1,000-$1,500/mo | Standard local business |
| Authority | + advanced content, link building, AI visibility monitoring, competitor tracking | $1,500-$2,500/mo | Multi-location, competitive markets |

**Pricing notes:**
- Charge one-time setup fee ($1,000-$2,500) for Strategy Sprint (Month 1)
- Below $1,000/month is difficult to deliver quality while building a team
- Annual contracts with monthly billing reduce churn (offer 10% annual discount)
- Raise prices on new clients, grandfather existing for 6-12 months

## Anchor-High Presentation Strategy

Consider presenting tiers highest-value first instead of lowest-first. Research in behavioral economics shows the first number seen becomes the price anchor:

- **Traditional (anchoring low):** Foundation → Growth → Authority. Result: most clients choose the cheapest option.
- **Anchor High:** Present Investment/Authority first → Growth → Foundation. Result: the middle tier becomes the most popular choice, increasing average deal size.

Key principles:
- Starting low triggers primal "hoarding instinct" and expense mindset
- Starting high keeps higher-level thinking for value-based decisions
- Frame options by value/outcomes, not deliverables (see Sales Process below)
- Present what they're MISSING at each lower tier, not what they're GAINING

## Model C: Strategic Consulting + AI Visibility (Premium)

Higher-touch, fewer clients, premium pricing.

- AI search audits and brand monitoring
- Entity optimization strategy
- Strategic roadmaps and competitive analysis
- Content strategy for AI citation
- Price: $2,000-$5,000 per project/audit

Best layered on top of Model B, or sold as standalone to executives concerned about AI disruption.

## Sales Process

### The Conversation Framework

1. **Discovery** — Ask about their business, how they get clients now, goals. Listen 70%.
2. **"Let me show you"** — Pull up their GBP, website, and search results live. Show competitor comparison. This creates the audible gasp.
3. **Frame the opportunity** — "When someone in [city] searches for [service], they see [competitor], not you. Here's what it takes to change that."
4. **Present the plan** — Walk through Phase 1 → 2 → 3. Show what happens at each stage. THEN give pricing.
5. **Handle objections** — Most common: "I need to think about it." The sales call is the bottleneck — practice it.

### Value-Based Proposal Framing

Stop listing deliverables (5 blog posts, 10 citations, weekly GBP posts) and start framing proposals around what the client GAINS at each level:

**Instead of:**
- Foundation: GBP management, 1 blog/month, review monitoring → $500-800/mo

**Try:**
- **Investment tier (presented first):** "Full market dominance — appear in Google Maps, AI search, and organic results for all your services across your entire service area. Includes competitor displacement strategy and AI visibility monitoring."
- **Growth tier:** "Strong local presence — rank for your primary services in your core city with consistent review growth and content authority."
- **Foundation tier:** "Essential visibility — maintain your Google presence and protect your online reputation."

The deliverables can be the same — only the FRAMING changes. Clients buy outcomes, not activities.

### Pricing Psychology: Avoid Budget Questions

Consider removing "What's your budget?" from intake forms and sales calls. This unintentionally sets a low price anchor and triggers expense mindset — the client's stated budget becomes the ceiling, and everything above it triggers "that's too expensive."

Instead: present value and pricing before asking about budget. Let the client decide what they value most after seeing the options.

### What Sells in 2026

- **The AI visibility angle:** "Have you checked if ChatGPT recommends your business?" Show them live. Then explain the work is the same as solid SEO.
- **The competitor gap:** "Your competitor has 47 reviews and you have 12. Here's the plan to close that gap."
- **The video audit:** Record yourself auditing their site, send it as a follow-up. High conversion because it demonstrates expertise.
- **The Google Setup gateway:** Many businesses lack GBP, GA4, or GSC. Offer setup as a low-cost entry point.

### What Doesn't Sell

- Technical jargon (schema, canonical, crawl budget)
- Promising specific rankings
- Selling "SEO" as a concept instead of outcomes ("more calls," "more patients")
- Competing on price

### AI Search as Sales Opportunity (Not Threat)

ChatGPT is <1% of daily searches and <1% of referral traffic. But clients don't know this. Use the AI buzz to:
- Start conversations ("Are you showing up in AI search?")
- Offer AI visibility as a premium add-on
- Explain that ranking in Google = getting recommended by AI (same work, different framing)
- Package AI monitoring into monthly reports
