# Local SEO Agency Skill

Help small agencies decide how to package, price, sell, and deliver local SEO consulting. This skill covers service models, pricing, sales process, lead generation, delivery systems, team building, and client retention.

## Service Models

There are three primary models. Most agencies start with Model A, graduate to Model B, then optionally layer on Model C.

### Model A: SEO Boost (One-Time, Entry Level)

A productized, one-time service ideal for web designers adding SEO or building confidence.

**Includes:**
- 3-5 keywords targeted
- Basic keyword research (free tools only)
- On-page optimization: page titles, meta descriptions, headers, alt text, copy tweaks
- Pages: homepage, services, location, about
- NOT content creation, Google setup, or ongoing management

**Pricing:**
- 3 keywords: $399
- 5 keywords: $499 (starting price) → $999 (goal price)
- 10 keywords: $999-$1,499

**Sell as:** Website project add-on, standalone product, lead-in to monthly services.
**Time to deliver:** 2-5 hours.
**Upsell path:** Include 90-day rank tracking as bonus → demonstrate results → upsell to monthly retainer.

### Model B: Monthly Retainer (Core Agency Model)

Recurring revenue engine. This is where real agency economics live.

| Tier | Includes | Price Range | Client Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| Foundation | GBP management, 1 blog/month, review monitoring, monthly report | $500-$800/mo | Maintenance, very small businesses |
| Growth | + page optimization, citation building, content strategy, keyword tracking | $1,000-$1,500/mo | Standard local business |
| Authority | + advanced content, link building, AI visibility monitoring, competitor tracking | $1,500-$2,500/mo | Multi-location, competitive markets |

**Pricing notes:**
- Charge one-time setup fee ($1,000-$2,500) for Strategy Sprint (Month 1)
- Below $1,000/month is difficult to deliver quality while building a team
- Annual contracts with monthly billing reduce churn (offer 10% annual discount)
- Raise prices on new clients, grandfather existing for 6-12 months

**Anchor-High Presentation Strategy:**
Consider presenting tiers highest-value first instead of lowest-first. Research in behavioral economics shows the first number seen becomes the price anchor:

- **Traditional (anchoring low):** Foundation → Growth → Authority. Result: most clients choose the cheapest option.
- **Anchor High:** Present Investment/Authority first → Growth → Foundation. Result: the middle tier becomes the most popular choice, increasing average deal size.

Key principles:
- Starting low triggers primal "hoarding instinct" and expense mindset
- Starting high keeps higher-level thinking for value-based decisions
- Frame options by value/outcomes, not deliverables (see Sales Process below)
- Present what they're MISSING at each lower tier, not what they're GAINING

### Model C: Strategic Consulting + AI Visibility (Premium)

Higher-touch, fewer clients, premium pricing.

- AI search audits and brand monitoring
- Entity optimization strategy
- Strategic roadmaps and competitive analysis
- Content strategy for AI citation
- Price: $2,000-$5,000 per project/audit

Best layered on top of Model B, or sold as standalone to executives concerned about AI disruption.

## Delivery System (Three Phases)

### Phase 1: Strategy Sprint (Month 1)

The main deliverable is a strategic plan the client can hold and understand.

**Tasks:**
1. Kickoff call — goals, audience, competitors, budget, USPs
2. GBP audit and initial optimization (quick win)
3. Technical SEO audit (basic — focus on major issues only, not comprehensive)
4. Keyword research database (service, location, long-tail, zero-volume)
5. Ideal sitemap with meta data specs
6. Competitor analysis (top 3-5)
7. 6-12 month strategy document
8. Early easy wins (GBP fixes, title tag updates, citation claims) for trust-building

### Phase 2: Build Phase (Months 2-5)

Execute the strategy — create and optimize pages.

**Tasks:**
1. Reoptimize existing pages based on keyword research
2. Build new service pages (one per service)
3. Build location/service area pages (with genuine unique content)
4. Implement schema markup (LocalBusiness, Service, FAQPage, BreadcrumbList)
5. Add customer stories, FAQs, featured projects to pages
6. Internal linking optimization
7. Multiple "coats of paint" — revisit pages to add depth over time

### Phase 3: Care Phase (Ongoing)

Maintain and grow authority.

**Tasks:**
1. Citation building — spaced over time, not all at once
2. Competitor backlink analysis — acquire their best citations
3. GBP posting — minimum once/week
4. Review generation system — consistent 2-5/month, never in bursts
5. Monthly reporting with clear wins highlighted
6. Content updates and new blog posts (customer stories, seasonal content)
7. Quarterly: competitor check, keyword refresh, strategy adjustment
8. AI visibility monitoring — track via GSC referral traffic from AI platforms, Microsoft Clarity bot data, CloudFlare analytics, and "How did you hear about us?" on contact forms. Quarterly manual ChatGPT/Gemini/Perplexity brand checks. Note: grid-based AI rank tracking tools are unreliable — LLM outputs are probabilistic and change every few minutes.
9. LSA management (where applicable) — LSAs now appear on 31% of tracked queries and are eating into map pack leads. For industries where LSAs are active, consider offering LSA setup, call coaching (Google AI transcribes calls and poor handling lowers visibility), and lead dispute management as an add-on service.

## Sales Process

### The Conversation Framework

1. **Discovery** — Ask about their business, how they get clients now, goals. Listen 70%.
2. **"Let me show you"** — Pull up their GBP, website, and search results live. Show competitor comparison. This creates the audible gasp.
3. **Frame the opportunity** — "When someone in [city] searches for [service], they see [competitor], not you. Here's what it takes to change that."
4. **Present the plan** — Walk through Phase 1 → 2 → 3. Show what happens at each stage. THEN give pricing.
5. **Handle objections** — Most common: "I need to think about it." The sales call is the bottleneck — practice it.

### Value-Based Proposal Framing

Stop listing deliverables (5 blog posts, 10 citations, weekly GBP posts) and start framing proposals around what the client GAINS at each level:

**Instead of:**
- Foundation: GBP management, 1 blog/month, review monitoring → $500-800/mo

**Try:**
- **Investment tier (presented first):** "Full market dominance — appear in Google Maps, AI search, and organic results for all your services across your entire service area. Includes competitor displacement strategy and AI visibility monitoring."
- **Growth tier:** "Strong local presence — rank for your primary services in your core city with consistent review growth and content authority."
- **Foundation tier:** "Essential visibility — maintain your Google presence and protect your online reputation."

The deliverables can be the same — only the FRAMING changes. Clients buy outcomes, not activities.

### Pricing Psychology: Avoid Budget Questions

Consider removing "What's your budget?" from intake forms and sales calls. This unintentionally sets a low price anchor and triggers expense mindset — the client's stated budget becomes the ceiling, and everything above it triggers "that's too expensive."

Instead: present value and pricing before asking about budget. Let the client decide what they value most after seeing the options.

### What Sells in 2026

- **The AI visibility angle:** "Have you checked if ChatGPT recommends your business?" Show them live. Then explain the work is the same as solid SEO.
- **The competitor gap:** "Your competitor has 47 reviews and you have 12. Here's the plan to close that gap."
- **The video audit:** Record yourself auditing their site, send it as a follow-up. High conversion because it demonstrates expertise.
- **The Google Setup gateway:** Many businesses lack GBP, GA4, or GSC. Offer setup as a low-cost entry point.

### What Doesn't Sell

- Technical jargon (schema, canonical, crawl budget)
- Promising specific rankings
- Selling "SEO" as a concept instead of outcomes ("more calls," "more patients")
- Competing on price

### AI Search as Sales Opportunity (Not Threat)

ChatGPT is <1% of daily searches and <1% of referral traffic. But clients don't know this. Use the AI buzz to:
- Start conversations ("Are you showing up in AI search?")
- Offer AI visibility as a premium add-on
- Explain that ranking in Google = getting recommended by AI (same work, different framing)
- Package AI monitoring into monthly reports

## Lead Generation

Ranked by ROI for small agencies:

### 1. Free Audit Offers (Lowest effort, fastest results)
Offer free 15-minute SEO audits. Use a checklist for efficiency. Identify top 3 issues. Present a paid plan.

### 2. Power Partner Referrals
Find complementary providers: web designers, graphic designers, paid ads specialists, business coaches. Refer leads both ways.

### 3. YouTube Audit Videos (Dennis Yu's "Content Factory")
Record audits of real businesses in your niche. Publish on YouTube. People watching will ask you to audit their site. Compounds over time.

**The content factory cycle:**
1. Create raw content (interviews, audits, conference footage, walk-and-talks)
2. Repurpose to YouTube, blog posts, social media, podcast
3. Boost with $1/day ads on mid-funnel educational content (NOT "book a call" ads)
4. Capture leads from inbound requests
5. Convert with free audit → paid engagement

### 4. Niche Conference Networking
Attend industry conferences for your target niche. Interview speakers and attendees. Create content from those interviews. You become known in the niche without being the domain expert.

### 5. Existing Client Referrals
Ask happy clients for referrals. Offer a referral bonus. Most underused lead source.

### 6. Personal Brand Content
LinkedIn, podcast, blog. Long-game but compounds. Demonstrate expertise publicly.

## The Lighthouse Strategy (Dennis Yu)

For agencies ready to scale in a niche:

1. **Find a Lighthouse** — Someone respected in your target industry (a successful roofer, well-known landscaper, etc.)
2. **Partner** — Put the agency under their name/brand. They bring credibility and access; you bring SEO expertise.
3. **Triangle model:** Lighthouse practitioner + your agency + optional niche software/tool. All three cross-refer leads.
4. **Content engine:** Interview the lighthouse and other industry players. Create videos, podcasts, blog posts. The lighthouse's network becomes your lead pipeline.

This works because trust transfers. A random SEO agency pitching roofers gets ignored. "Anthony's Roofing Growth Agency" (where Anthony is a well-known roofer with 70 employees) gets meetings.

## Niching Strategy

Every successful local SEO agency specializes. Options:

- **Industry niche:** One vertical (HVAC, dental, legal). Reuse keyword research, templates, and case studies.
- **Geographic niche:** One metro area. Become THE local SEO provider for that market.
- **Size niche:** 1-10 location businesses, or solopreneurs, or multi-location chains.
- **Hybrid:** 2-3 related industries in one metro (e.g., healthcare providers in DMV area).

### Why niching works
- Keyword research is reusable across clients in same industry
- Content templates, schema, and SOPs transfer directly
- Case studies compound ("we helped 15 dentists rank #1")
- Industry conferences put you in front of hundreds of prospects
- Specialists charge 2-3x what generalists charge

### Full Productization

Take niching a step further: build one standardized "machine" (website structure, service delivery system) and sell it repeatedly. Customize only the surface — colors, fonts, images, business-specific details — while the underlying architecture, page templates, keyword research framework, and content structure remain the same.

This scales because:
- Every new client gets a proven system, not a custom experiment
- Delivery time drops dramatically (2 weeks instead of 2 months)
- Quality stays consistent as you grow
- Junior team members can execute the playbook without reinventing it each time

## Building SOPs (When to Write What)

At 5 clients, you MUST have written SOPs. Without them you can't hire, train, or maintain quality.

**Priority order:**
1. Client onboarding checklist
2. GBP optimization SOP
3. On-page optimization SOP
4. Monthly reporting template
5. Review generation workflow
6. Citation building process
7. Content creation process
8. Keyword research process

## Team Building Sequence

**Solo ($0-50K):** You do everything. Focus on systems and getting to 5 clients.
**First hire (~5 clients):** SEO assistant or VA. Train on SOPs. College interns work well and are affordable.

**Strategic First Hire Framework (10/10/80):**
When you hire your first person, be intentional about how you use the freed time:
- **10%** → Personal time (the benefit of being a business owner)
- **10%** → Leadership development (growing yourself + developing your hire)
- **80%** → Revenue-producing activities (the things that have historically brought in money)

Don't hire to "have more free time" — hire so freed hours go directly into revenue-generating work. The hire should pay for itself within weeks.

**How to identify what to delegate:** List all tasks from last week with hours and energy level. Circle tasks that don't generate revenue, don't require unique judgment, and could be taught in 1-2 days. Star 10 hours worth — that's your first hire's job description.

**Second hire (~10-15 clients):** Client success manager or operations manager. Frees you to sell and strategize.
**Third hire (~20+ clients):** Additional SEO strategist or specialist. Now you have capacity for 30-35 clients.

**Key rule:** You cannot hire without systems. Write SOPs first, then hire someone to follow them.

## Client Retention

**The sieve principle:** If clients are churning, don't try to acquire faster — fix the retention problem first.

**Retention tactics:**
1. Show results early — quick wins in Month 1 build trust
2. Report consistently — monthly reports showing progress, even small wins
3. Be proactive — tell clients what you did before they wonder
4. Educate — clients who understand your work churn less
5. Respond within 24 hours, even if just "got it, looking into this"
6. Celebrate wins together — when rankings improve or a lead comes through, tell the client immediately

**Target:** <1% monthly churn (2-3 clients/year at 20 clients). At 5% churn you'll spend all your time replacing clients.

## Agency Operations: Quarterly Planning

For agency owners drowning in client work, strategic planning is the first casualty. Without a plan, the whirlwind of client work always wins.

### The System
1. **Quarterly:** Half-day planning session. Identify top 2 goals (most immediate impact). Create SMART goal declarations. Break into 2-hour action items.
2. **Weekly:** 30-minute planning session before the week starts. Block 2-4 hours for goal work. Gather resources so you can start immediately.
3. **Weekly:** Execute the blocked time ("CEO time"). Don't cancel — you are your most important client.

### Key Principles
- Limit to 2-3 goals per quarter. Research shows teams given 4-10 goals only accomplish 1-2. Teams given 11-20 accomplish zero.
- The urgent (client work) always beats the important (business strategy) unless you schedule strategy first.
- Consider this your "business development retainer" — the same dedicated time you give clients, applied to your own agency.
