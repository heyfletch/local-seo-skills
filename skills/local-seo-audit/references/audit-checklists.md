Check and score:

1. **Review Volume** — Total review count vs competitors
2. **Review Rating** — Average rating (4.5+ is competitive)

## C. On-Page / Website Audit (Weight: 33% of local organic)

Check and score:

### 1. Service Pages
- Dedicated page for EVERY individual service (not one combined page)
- Each page 1,500-2,500 words (guideline — completeness > length)

- Clear CTAs (above fold + bottom)
- Internal links to related services (3-5)
- Pricing transparency (specific or range)
- **Real photos** (people, actual work, results — NOT AI-generated images)

- Include: local landmarks, demographics, neighborhoods, local partnerships
- Local testimonials from that area
- Embedded Google Map specific to that area
- Neighborhood and zip code coverage

### 3. Technical On-Page
- Title tags: Front-load conversion copy (primary keyword + location + brand in first ~60 chars for display), then back-load SEO keywords past the truncation point — extra service names, service areas, keyword variations (up to 270 chars indexed even though users see "..."). Check if competitors are using this hidden keyword strategy.
- Meta descriptions: 150-160 chars with keyword + CTA
- H1-H3 hierarchy (one H1 per page)

4. **Industry Links** — Links from industry directories, associations
5. **Competitor Comparison** — Link gap analysis
6. **Toxic Links** — Spammy or harmful backlinks
7. **Anchor Text Distribution** — Natural vs over-optimized

Note: Backlink weight is DECLINING for local pack rankings in 2026 but still matters for local organic results.

## E. Citation Audit (Weight: 7% local pack, 13% AI search)

Check and score:

1. **NAP Consistency** — Name, Address, Phone exactly the same everywhere
2. **Tier 1 Citations** — Google, Bing, Apple Maps, Facebook, Yelp, BBB, YP, Foursquare
3. **Tier 2 Citations** — Nextdoor, industry-specific directories
4. **Industry-Specific Directories** — More important than general NAP citations for AI search in 2026
5. **Data Aggregators** — Neustar Localeze, Foursquare, Data Axle
6. **"Best Of" Lists** — LLMs heavily cite "Best [Service] in [City]" lists for AI recommendations
7. **Duplicate Listings** — Identify and resolve

## F. AI Search Visibility Audit (NEW 2026)

**Context:** AI search (ChatGPT, Gemini) is growing but still <1% of daily searches and <1% of referral traffic. For local businesses, AI queries with local intent almost always trigger web search (RAG) — so ranking well in traditional search drives AI visibility too. Don't panic, but don't ignore it.

Check and score:

1. **AI Overview Appearance** — Does business appear in Google AI Overviews for key terms?
2. **ChatGPT Visibility** — Does ChatGPT mention business? (uses Bing, Wikipedia, Yelp, BBB, Foursquare — NOT Google)
3. **Structured Data** — Schema markup present and valid (feeds AI Knowledge Graph)
4. **First-Party Testimonials** — LLMs crawl website testimonial pages to verify reputation
5. **Content Citability** — Is content structured so AI can extract and cite it?
6. **Industry Directory Presence** — More impactful than generic NAP for AI citations
7. **Brand SERP** — What appears when someone searches the business name?
8. **Entity Consistency Check** — Google the brand name, ask ChatGPT "Who is [brand]?" — is the description accurate? Are bio, titles, services consistent across website, LinkedIn, GBP, directories? AI triangulates identity from multiple sources; inconsistencies cause confusion.

### AI Visibility Tracking — What Works
- Google Search Console — check referral traffic from AI platforms (chatgpt.com, gemini.google.com)
- Microsoft Clarity — tracks when LLMs visit your site
- CloudFlare — bot tracking data
- "How did you hear about us?" on contact forms (some agencies report ~11% of leads cite ChatGPT)
- Manual spot checks — periodically ask ChatGPT/Gemini about the business

### What Doesn't Work (2026)
Grid-based AI rank tracking tools (AI equivalents of Local Falcon) are unreliable — LLM outputs are probabilistic and results change every few minutes for the same query. Avoid paying for AI rank tracking tools until the technology matures.

### Multi-Site Visibility Strategy
For AI visibility, the business doesn't need to rank its own website #1. LLMs synthesize answers from multiple sources in the top 10-20 results. Audit whether the business is mentioned across: "Best [Service] in [City]" articles, industry directories, local publications, and review platforms. Digital PR and third-party mentions matter more for AI citation than they do for traditional SEO.

## F2. SERP Landscape Check

For top 5-10 target keywords, check the SERP layout:

1. **Local Service Ads (LSAs) present?** — If yes, note that LSAs capture ~5% average CTR (up to 20%+ for high-trust verticals like lawyers). Consider recommending a paid ads partner.
2. **Map pack position** — Inside or outside visible results?
3. **AI Overview present?** — Informational queries most affected
4. **Number of organic results visible** — Ads increasingly compress organic space
5. **LSA growth trend** — LSAs now appear on 31% of tracked queries (up from 11% at start of 2025). For industries where LSAs are active, note that leads/calls from the map pack may be declining as LSAs capture attention first. Consider recommending LSA management as part of the strategy.

## G. Competitor Analysis

For top 3-5 competitors, compare:

| Metric | Client | Comp A | Comp B | Comp C |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Domain Authority | | | | |
| Organic Traffic | | | | |
| Keywords Ranking | | | | |
| GBP Reviews (count) | | | | |
| GBP Rating | | | | |
| Blog Posts (90 days) | | | | |
| Service Pages | | | | |
| Location Pages | | | | |
| GBP Post Frequency | | | | |
| Schema Markup | | | | |

## H. Analytics & ROI Tracking Audit

Check whether the client can prove SEO ROI:

1. **GA4 Funnel Explorations** — Are custom funnels set up tracking: blog/service page visit → product/service page → conversion? Use open funnels (not closed) since users enter at different points.
2. **Custom Events** — Are important interactions tracked in GTM (form submissions, button clicks, call clicks)?
3. **Saved Reports** — Are funnel explorations saved as custom reports in the GA4 library for consistent monitoring?
4. **Segment Comparisons** — Can they compare by device type, traffic source, and geography?

If none of this exists, flag it as a priority setup item. Proving ROI is what prevents client churn.
