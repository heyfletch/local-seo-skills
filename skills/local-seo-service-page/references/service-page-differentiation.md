# Service Page Differentiation Guide

## Content Differentiation Rules

**DO:**
- Include original data, stats, or insights unique to this business
- Reference specific local context when relevant
- Address questions competitors don't answer
- Include real case studies or anonymized client outcomes
- Write content that demonstrates first-hand experience (E-E-A-T)

**DON'T:**
- Copy competitor page structure or content
- Use generic filler ("We are committed to quality...")
- Stuff keywords unnaturally
- Use passive voice excessively
- Write in first person (use second person: you/your)
- Include "what is [service]" sections unless searchers genuinely need education

## Information Gain for AI Discoverability

For AI search visibility, include exhaustive business detail on every service page. People prompt LLMs with detailed, paragraph-long descriptions of what they want. The LLM matches businesses to those specific attributes — if you haven't mentioned it, you won't be recommended.

Consider including: insurance accepted, certifications and licenses, years of experience, specific techniques or approaches used, equipment brands, pricing transparency, response times, guarantees, specializations, languages spoken, accessibility features, and any other attribute a potential customer might specify when asking an AI for recommendations.

This is different from traditional SEO where you optimize for "[service] [city]." Now you also need to answer every possible attribute a customer might specify.

## Understanding LLM Sub-Queries

When someone asks an AI "recommend 5 dentists in Denver that accept Delta Dental," the LLM breaks this into 8+ sub-queries behind the scenes. Consider what sub-queries your target audience might trigger and ensure your service pages cover those topics. You can reveal these sub-queries using Chrome DevTools (Network tab > search "search_model_queries" for ChatGPT) or the Gemini Grounding API.

## Service Page Refresh Protocol

Service pages should be refreshed on a ~3 month cycle. A "significant" update means:
- Change to the title tag
- Change to the H1
- Structural changes to H2s
- ~30% of content updated

Freshness signals tell Google the page is current and maintained. After building all service pages and sub-service pages, cycle back to refresh the earliest ones, then repeat. This continuous refresh cycle can be as impactful as blogging for rankings.
